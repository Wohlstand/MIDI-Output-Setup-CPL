# MIDI Output Setup CPL

It is a small utility and the control panel applet to change the
default MIDI output settings. This module should help users of
Windows Vista/7/8/8.1/10, which doesn't have the standard ability
to choose the MIDI output device.

Why I made one another MIDI output configure tool? Because the rest of
them are not so good and doesn't work correctly. I had to see the work
of MIDI Output switching inside of a BASSMIDI Driver, developed by Kode54
previously. So, it was the BEST way of default MIDI Output changing I knew.
So, to don't install BASSMIDI Driver when I don't need it for always,
I better have the independent tool and control panel applet that does
this function well as BASSMIDI Driver configures tool does.
